		//      Yes sometimes other dinosaurs think I am stealing their food.
		//
		//Why do you collect them?
		//		I think the rocks are pretty
		//      I like how the bones look
		//      The bones make me seem way more intimidating, almost like I killed them myself
		//		It shows how far I have traveled
		//      Sometimes I want a reminder of what I have done.
